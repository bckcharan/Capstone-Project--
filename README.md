# Capstone-Project---CFPB-Analysis

After conducting the secondary research of CFPB and financial institutions functionality, and evaluation of products or services offered to consumers, it is concluded that the undertaken project will add value to all the stakeholders. Pre-information of company response, seriousness of complaints, and potential issues, will assist consumers to take better decisions while opting for services, facilitate financial institutions to improve customer service and optimize usage of resources, and support CFPB to maintain integrity among the stakeholders. Deployment of models in real business operations, while considering the business constraints, will allow the stakeholders to function efficiently, however, continuous monitoring, improvement, and viability check of outcomes are necessary to make it a success.
